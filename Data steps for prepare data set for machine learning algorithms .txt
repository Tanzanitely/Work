1.Convert response variable to logical
2.Check if there is any missing value in response variable. If True, remove.
3.Check if there is missing value in variables. If True, replace with NA.
4.Check if there is NULL value in variables. If True, replace with NA.
5.Check if there is space in the strings of the values. If True, remove spaces or replace with -.
6.After all the changes, check the vector types. Convert to factor, interger, or logical respectively according to need.
7.When doing sampling on imbalanced data set, convert response variable to factor first and then do sampling. After   sampling, convert response variabe back to logical for performing machine learning algorithlms.
